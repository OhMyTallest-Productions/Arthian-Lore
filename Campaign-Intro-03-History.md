#### History

***Elroode I*** came to power in the year 640 in the petty kingdom of **Arthia**, a small, centrally located province on the northern continent of **Easorhn**. He immediately went on a campaign of conquest, eventually controlling most of modern day **Greater Arthia**. Sometime in 644 he took the title High King to denote his expanding conquest and added the prefix '***Greater***' to his much-expanded realm of **Arthia**. Upon his death without an heir, his crown was taken by his seneschal, ***Kargon***. It's borders have since stayed more or less the same and the people have drifted ever more towards lawful evil over the centuries.

#### High Kings of Greater Arthia

- ***Elroode I***    -  640 to 646

The populace assume that the last 8 kings of this empire are showing respect for their ancestors by taking the name of his predecessors; this couldn't be farther from the truth. All eight kings named ***Kargon*** were, in fact, the same being. ***Kargon*** was, in fact, a cambion and used this ruse to keep the population from rising up against his tyranny with the full knowledge of the ***Arthian Council of Ministers***.
