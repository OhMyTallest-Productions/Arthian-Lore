###### Question:

DMGII: "A criminal organization run in an evil region (a slave trader in a nation in which slavery is legal, for example) is instead treated as a service, a shop, or other ordinary business."Are there things that count as illegal in Greater Arthia? Or is it basically realm by realm, and so none of our in-realm business counts as criminal?

###### Answer:

Okay, here's my initial take on this:Greater Arthia IS a lawful evil empire; so there are a highly codified set of laws. If an accuser has evidence or enjoys the benefits of nepotism they can really make your day painful at the Empire level. However, justice has a way of getting waylaid (or outright ignored) the farther from one of the three Metropoli you get.

1. Tax Evasion is an especially big no no; anything can be deemed illegal if the crown doesn't get it's cut.
2. Impersonating an officer of the crown (especially a tax official) is an automatic death sentence.
3. Killing a member of the Arthian Council of Ministers is an automatic death sentence.
4. Killing a clergyman of the Arthian Catholic Church results in immediate excommunication and an automatic 1 million gold piece bounty offered by the church for your head.
5. Murder of anyone else is illegal without the proper paperwork from the crown (assassin's guild contacts will get you these).
   Theft is illegal without the proper paperwork from the crown.
6. While slavery is frowned upon in view of society, it is not inherently illegal unless you don't have the proper paperwork showing you have the permission of the crown.
7. Being higher in status/power isolates you to a degree from accusation of all but the first four above; the crown will get its share from everyone, regardless of who they are and absolutely nobody gets away with harming either the CoM or the Church.

Anything else is (at least for the nonce) going to be realm by realm.
